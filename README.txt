==== Unity 6 Preview Renderer Feature examples utilizing Render Graph

This is a collection of example Renderer Features for Unity 6 Preview/URP 17.

URP 17 integrates the Render Graph API, which significantly changes the way custom render passes are written.

This collection contains examples of commonly used features, such as fullscreen blit and drawing renderers.

The examples are in the Assets/Samples directory.  Each sample has an accompanying README.txt.

NOTE: There are also official URP Render Graph examples available in the Package Manager.  You can import them from the Universal RP package in the "Samples" tab.
